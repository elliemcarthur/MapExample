                <h2>NASA's Wallops Flight Facility Tour</h2>

                Wallops Flight Facility is NASA's primary facility for suborbital missions.  The facility launches sounding rockets, scientific balloons and performs aircraft research. Once we arrive by bus from the Ocean Pines Community Center, we will pick up an escort who will take us on a tour of the facility.  We will make several stops during the day, leaving enough time for lunch at the cafeteria (not included in fee).  We will end with a drive-by of the launch pad area. Where we stop depends upon what the facility is working on at the time.  Call 410-641-7052 for more information or to register.
